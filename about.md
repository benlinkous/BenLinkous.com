# About Me

Hi, I'm Ben Linkous — but you can call me Link.

I'm a U.S. Army veteran with over 30 years of service across mechanical, medical, leadership, and career development roles. After retiring, I set out to bridge my experiences in human service and technical operations with my passion for learning and digital innovation.

This site — BenLinkous.com — is my personal hub. It's where I document my journey, projects, lessons, and reflections. I'm building an ecosystem of connected sites to serve veterans, learners, communities, and those chasing purpose.
