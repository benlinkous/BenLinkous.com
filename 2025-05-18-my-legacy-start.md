# My Legacy Starts with Service
*May 18, 2025*

I’ve always believed that legacy isn’t what you leave behind — it’s what you build into others. This site is the start of documenting that legacy.

From military service to transitioning into IT, from coaching others to launching tools like LinkOS — I’m here to make it visible.

This is my lab notebook, my legacy log, and my place to reflect out loud. Expect writing on:
- Cybersecurity learning
- Veteran transition coaching
- Linux and open-source tools
- Legacy and leadership

Thanks for walking with me.
